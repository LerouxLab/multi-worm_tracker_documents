## Protocol for culturing worms for behavior:

### Materials:

- NGM plates (~3 days old)
- OP50 E. coli (maximum 2 weeks old)
- Healthy, well fed, gravid C. elegans

### Method:

1.	Using sterile technique, pipette 50 ul of OP50 onto each plate. Use a sterilized glass rod to spread the bacteria evenly across the plate (trying not to let the bacteria go all the way to the edge of the plate).
2.	Let plates dry on bench top at room temperature for 1.5 - 2 days.
3.	Once plates are dry (1.5 – 2 days later) proceed with making synchronous colonies: pick ~ 5 gravid adults onto seeded food plates, making sure that no eggs or babies are transferred with them. Leave them to lay eggs for 3-4 hrs and then remove the adults. Store inverted plates in plastic at 20 C until ready to test behavior.


### Notes:

I suggest culturing 5 plates per strain you want to test (in case of contamination or other plate problems). It is also imperative to run 4 plates of N2 every time you do an experiment. 

Also, when labeling your plates please write on the sides of the Petri plates and not on the bottom (will interfere with the tracker).
